This project is a comparison of various React state management paradigms.

## Overview

The goal of the examples is to enable you to see both code and final implementation examples
in a more complex environment than something like TodoMVC.

Scenarios addressed so far:

1. Input entry and propagation of values to sibling components.
2. Performance under heavy load
3. Asynchronous fetching of data and injection into application state

## Examples

Examples can be found in `/src/examples` in a folder named similar to the library or framework demonstrated.
